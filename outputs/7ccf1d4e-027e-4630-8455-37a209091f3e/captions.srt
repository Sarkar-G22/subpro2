1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
Now, I went to the vegetable shop before that, he asked Brother Broccoli

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,500
So, Brother Bhola, why do you eat Videshi

3
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,519
They eat Gobi

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,859
And now I think they are a little aware of it

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,039
Because the quality of the food was also good in India

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,300
In 18th, 19th century Britishers came and only the food was not there

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,140
Alotamater, Papita, Pumpkin, Gajar, Patta, Gobi Peanuts and Mirchi

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,739
Where the friends of Mirchi were also good in India

9
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,539
All these vegetables were brought from India in 18th century in British people

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,780
And after many years, we have forgotten that these vegetables were from Videshi

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,899
Today, Mirchi Alotamater is our main ingredient, and we cannot imagine without it

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,539
That is why I always say that do not resist change

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,340
Because change will remain in society

14
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:46,500
And you too will forget the Sunar and Later

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,679
The question is when you will forget, fast or late

16
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,740
If we take history and study, then we will not be in any danger

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,600
In India, all the people who live in India were not Indians

18
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,020
They were from Africa, from America

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,079
Tynasors have been ruled 20 crore years in this state

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,719
And we have only been 2-3 lakhs

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,719
I am putting a video here, I will see it all
