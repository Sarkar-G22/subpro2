00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
Alright, so should you learn to code or let AI do coding for you

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,240
I mean there are like crazy amount of AI tools right now that can actually take a simple

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,500
Text input and convert it into a real project

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:16,739
For example, let's say you want to create a dashboard for your SAS application or create

5
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:21,460
A simple to do app or maybe a not taking app, simply open one of these AI tools, give it

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,620
A simple text prompt and the code should be ready in no time

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,420
So it all started with the introduction of chat GPT

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,299
So back in the days when chat GPT was initially announced, if a person want to develop

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,579
A let's say code and HTML page with some basic styling and stuff, he could write away

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:41,159
Open chat GPT and ask it to code the same and chat GPT should give the code in no time

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,719
Similarly let's say some basic JavaScript project PHP Python

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,020
I mean chat GPT was capable enough to write code for all of these popular frameworks

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,780
And libraries and programming languages

14
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,640
After chat GPT came other AI chat boards like cloud AI which performed way better

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,920
When it comes to coding sort of things and then various different LLMS and AI models
