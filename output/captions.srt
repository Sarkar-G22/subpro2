00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,859
Okay, let's do some tests

2
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,500
Tell me when you see something that makes sound

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,679
I see a speaker which makes sound

4
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,019
What is that part of the speaker called

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,339
That is the tweeter

6
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:27,539
It produces high frequency sounds

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,079
Give me a creative alliteration about these

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,340
Creative crayons color cheerfully

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,759
They certainly craft colorful creations

10
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,259
What does that part of the code do

11
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:54,039
This code defines encryption and decryption functions

12
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:01,219
It seems to use AESCBC encryption to encode and decode data based on a key and an

13
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,920
Initialization vector, IV

14
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,180
That's right

15
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,260
What neighborhood do you think I'm in

16
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,180
This appears to be the King's Cross area of London

17
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:19,120
It is known for its railway station and transportation connections

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,180
Do you remember where you saw my glasses

19
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,659
Yes, I do

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,140
Your glasses were on the desk and you were red apple

21
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,099
What can I add here to make this system faster

22
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:50,739
Adding a cache between the server and database could improve speed

23
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,540
What does this remind you of

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,879
Trudginger's cat

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,120
Alright, give me a ban name for this duo

26
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,340
Golden Strikes

27
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:10,419
Nice

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,460
Thanks, Dominic

29
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you
